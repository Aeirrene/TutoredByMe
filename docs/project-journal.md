## âœ… March 26, 2025 â€” Day 1: Brainstorming & Planning

### Questions Iâ€™m Thinking About:

1. What are all the features I want this tutoring site to have?
2. Do I want to wireframe the layout or just dive into code with a simple vision?

### Vision:

I want a clean, simple 2-page app:

- Main page: Introduction + services + contact form
- Second page: Appointment scheduling system

### Inspiration / Goals:

- Learn to connect a frontend to a backend using Express & MongoDB
- Build REST APIs on my own
- Practice React component structure
- Have a project Iâ€™m proud of on my resume and GitHub
